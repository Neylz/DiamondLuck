- **What it is ?**
This datapack is an adapted version of the [TopLuck](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/topluck.45738/) plugin.

Diamond Luck is a datapack for administrators and moderators of multiplayer survival servers.

With it, you can see a "luck" rate of each player. This percentage is calculated according to the number of diamonds and stones mined. A player with a high percentage, is possibly a player using cheating options such as XRay or Baritone.
The moderators will be able to monitor these players during their mining and implement the necessary sanctions if necessary.
