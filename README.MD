- **What it is ?**
This datapack is an adapted version of the [TopLuck](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/topluck.45738/) plugin.

Diamond Luck is a datapack for administrators and moderators of multiplayer survival servers.

With it, you can see a "luck" rate of each player. This percentage is calculated according to the number of diamonds and stones mined. A player with a high percentage, is possibly a player using cheating options such as XRay or Baritone.
The moderators will be able to monitor these players during their mining and implement the necessary sanctions if necessary. 

 - **Benefits**

The advantage of being in the form of a datapack is to be compatible with the latest versions of the game easily AND to be usable whatever the software running your server (Spigot, Paper, Bukkit, Sponge, Forge, Fabric, Vanilla...).

- **Fast warning**

On some of these server software, mods or plugins modifying the operation of minecraft vanilla controls can be installed. This can create important dysfunctions on this datapack.
